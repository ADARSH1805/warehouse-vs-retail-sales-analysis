A Comparative Analysis of Warehouse vs. Retail Sales Performance
Minor Project – INT375 | Data Science Specialization

Dataset Source
This analysis is based on a public dataset sourced from Data.gov. The dataset includes comprehensive sales records over time, categorized by item types, sales channels, and suppliers.

Dataset Overview
Rows: 307,000+

Columns: Year, Month, Item Type, Retail Sales, Warehouse Sales, Transfers, etc.

Item Categories: WINE, BEER, LIQUOR, NON-ALCOHOL, STR_SUPPLIES, and more

Why Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?
EDA is a critical initial step in any data science project. It allows us to:

Understand data distribution and structure

Detect missing or anomalous values

Discover relationships and patterns

Prepare data for further modeling or insights

Steps Performed in EDA:
Cleaned data (missing values, duplicates)

Created Date and Total Sales columns

Performed univariate and bivariate analysis

Visualized trends using histograms, bar charts, line plots, and scatter plots

Project Objectives & Analysis
1. Monthly, Quarterly & Yearly Sales Trends
Clear seasonality observed

Q2 and Q4 had highest average sales, likely due to seasonal demand

2. Retail vs Warehouse Sales Comparison
Warehouse sales contributed ~75% of total sales

Retail showed steadier performance over time

3. Top-Selling Product Categories
WINE and LIQUOR were top performers in sales revenue

BEER had high volume but moderate total value

4. Price vs Quantity Sold Correlation
A negative correlation suggests that as prices increase, quantity sold decreases

Reflects consumer price sensitivity

5. Peak Sales Months
November & December showed spikes in sales across categories

Likely driven by holiday season demands

Key Visualizations
Histogram: Total Sales Distribution

Bar Chart: Sales by Item Type

Line Plot: Monthly Sales Trends

Scatter Plot: Price vs Quantity Correlation

Pie Chart: Channel-wise Contribution

Conclusion
This EDA provided valuable insights into:

How different channels (retail vs. warehouse) perform

Seasonality in sales patterns

The role of product type and pricing on revenue and quantity

Customer behavior trends that can inform future strategy

It strengthened skills in:

Data preprocessing & cleaning

Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Analytical thinking and storytelling through data
